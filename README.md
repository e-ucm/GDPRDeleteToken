LimeGDPR Plugin

You have to enable this plugin from its settings before usage. 

See https://medium.com/@evently/gdpr-plugin-f7e600219885 for more info!

Use @@@TOKENREMOVE@@@ and @@TOKENREMOVE@@ in your e-mail template to embed the url.

Note: Secret to hash the url: a phrase or key combination you should add that creates a unique hash per token, so only users can access their data. Once set, don't change this: all links created earlier will no longer work if you do!
